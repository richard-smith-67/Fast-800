## 06 March 2021 - Day before start

86.7kg

Breakfast - cereal, coffee and a cream croissant. 

Lunch - leftover soup from day before and some cheese on toast

[Fast800](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Fast-800-combine-intermittent-long-term/dp/1780723628/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=fast+800&qid=1615143147&sr=8-2) is delivered. I read about half of it. Having done the 5:2 diet I wanted a more hardcore approach. Mosley is credible and bases his books on current research.

Final snack at 8pm - 2 slices of cheese on toast with onion and salad cream (nom!)

Lots of cups of coffee throughout day.

## Day 1

I read most of the rest of Fast800 and check out some of the recipes. I make a shopping list and wander off to Morrison's. While in Morrison's I revise my plans and decide to kick off the diet with a small fast - nothing major, maybe 2-3 days if I can manage it. I've tried this once before and managed 2.5 days before cracking in the middle of the night and gorging on sardine sandwiches and cornflakes...

I order [ketosis strips](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B084VKSW5G/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) a [blood sugar monitor](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B08146YKWY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and some [meal replacement shake](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0013GKCE4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) just because...

19:06 - fucking starving and pretty grumpy. Almost 24 hours since last meal. Had about five cups of black coffee and water so far today.

Midnight - Stomach rumbling. Can't stop thinking about eating. I know I'll never get to sleep. I crack. Half a tin of lentil and bacon soup, 2 baby beetroot and some small slices of cheese...

## Day 2

86kg

08.45 - 40g porridge, 250ml milk, 1 cup black coffee

12:30 - remainder of lentil and bacon soup from last night, handful of edamame beans, some broccoli and a couple of baby beetroot

Afternoon - lots of black coffee. Blood glucose monitor arrives. Getting blood from my finger proves as successful as getting blood from a stone. Stab various fingers, waste three needles. Give up in disgust. There must be a YouTube video on this (there is). Try again. Fail. Wonder if I should try stabbing a vein in my arm...

19:30 - chicken and lentil curry (nom!) I should add that this was a paltry 1.5 chicken thighs and a few spoonfuls of green lentils. Have put remainders in fridge/freezer.

I forgot to mention I'm also attempting TRE (time restricted eating). Initially going for eating day's food in one 12hr period. May try and further restrict depending on how I feel. The idea is that the longer your body is in a fasting state the more fat is burnt (no shit Sherlock). Eating before bed is especially bad as blood sugar and insulin levels remain high throughout the night. High insulin levels stops fat from breaking down.

## Day 3

85.7kg

Wake up no hungrier than usual.

09:10 - 40g porridge, 250ml milk

13:00 - 2 egg omelette, handful of mushrooms, 1/4 onion, 3 slivers of cheese, handful of edamame beans, handful of broccoli. Actually stuffed.

18:30 - Same curry and amount as yesterday, handful of brocolli and edamame beans. Lemon tea.

19:55 - Want lots of wine. Listen to loud music instead.

21:04 - **Super grumpy!** Shouting at the internet. I think upstair's neighbour might have heard me. Hang up some washing and try and placate myself with lemon tea.
